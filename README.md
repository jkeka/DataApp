A small C# console application made with Visual Studio which retrieves information from different information sources on the internet to combine and display them. 

The application fetches random user information from www.randomuser.me API, and uses that information to display name, location city and the present weather of the city.
It then calculates the distance between Turku and that city using Haversine formula. 
NOTE! The coordinates provided by randomuser.com are not real, so the distance calculation between cities give erroneous results.

API-key is hidden for security purposes, code can be tested with own free API-key provided by www.openweathermap.org
